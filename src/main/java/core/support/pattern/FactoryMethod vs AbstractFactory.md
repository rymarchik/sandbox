To sum up, the Factory Method uses inheritance as a design tool. Meanwhile, Abstract Factory uses delegation. 
The first relies on a derived class to implement, whereas the base provides expected behavior. 
Additionally, itâ€™s over-method and not over a class. On the other hand, Abstract Factory is applied over a class. 
Both follow OCP and SRP, producing a loosely coupled code and more flexibility for future changes in our code base. 
The creation code is in one place.
