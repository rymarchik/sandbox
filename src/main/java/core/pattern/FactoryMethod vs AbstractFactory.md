The Factory Method uses inheritance as a design tool. Meanwhile, Abstract Factory uses delegation.  
The first relies on a derived class to implement, whereas the base provides expected behavior.  
Additionally, itâ€™s over-method and not over a class. On the other hand, Abstract Factory is applied over a class.  
Both follow OCP and SRP, producing a loosely coupled code and more flexibility for future changes in our code base.  
The creation code is in one place.

| **Purpose**           | Creates a single product (object) based on a specific implementation.                              | Creates families of related or dependent products (objects) without specifying their concrete classes.     |
| **Number of Products**| Focuses on the creation of one product or object type.                                             | Focuses on the creation of multiple related products (e.g., a theme with buttons, text boxes, etc.).        |
| **Class Hierarchy**   | Relies on subclassing and overriding the factory method in derived classes to specify the product. | Provides a central interface for creating families of products without the need for subclassing.           |
| **Flexibility**       | Provides flexibility in deciding which specific object to create by overriding the factory method. | Ensures consistency across families of products (e.g., all components of a GUI have the same theme).        |
| **Example Use Case**  | A logger that can create different types of log outputs (e.g., `FileLogger`, `ConsoleLogger`).     | A UI toolkit where buttons and menus need to match a specific style (e.g., `DarkThemeFactory`, `LightThemeFactory`). |
| **Implementation Complexity** | Simpler to implement as it focuses on one product.                                          | More complex due to the need to manage multiple related product types.                                      |
| **When to Use**       | When you want to delegate object creation to subclasses.                                           | When you need to ensure that a set of objects (family) works together and adheres to a specific interface. |
